# freecodecamp-product-landing-page
What I implemented in this project
1. Introduced the use of position fixed to make the navbar always be at the top of the viewport (position: sticky, top: 0; can have the same effect
2. Introduced use of media quary to achieve responsiveness to device types
3. Introduced to use of flexbox
